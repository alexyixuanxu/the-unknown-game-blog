				<H2>Limbo</H2>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Limbo is a puzzle-platform video game developed by independent studio Playdead. The game was released in July 2010 on Xbox Live Arcade, and has since been ported to several other systems, including the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows. Limbo is a 2D side-scroller, incorporating a physics system that governs environmental objects and the player character. The player guides an unnamed boy through dangerous environments and traps as he searches for his sister. The developer built the game's puzzles expecting the player to fail before finding the correct solution. Playdead called the style of play "trial and death", and used gruesome imagery for the boy's deaths to steer the player from unworkable solutions.</p>

				<H2>Cube Escape</H2>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cube Escape is a series of Surreal Horror Room Escape games created by Dutch game site Rusty Lake and available to play for free on their website. Unlike many Room Escape games, Cube Escape is noteworthy for having a complex, ongoing, non-linear storyline with surreal themes and visual styling evocative of filmmakers such as Dario Argento, David Lynch and Luis Bu√±uel. As a result, players can expect a great deal of nightmarish imagery and gore.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The individual games have quite varied settings and objectives, but which are all linked by mysterious black and white cubes. As the story progresses, the nature of the cubes and their relationship to the mysterious location known as Rusty Lake are gradually revealed.</p>
